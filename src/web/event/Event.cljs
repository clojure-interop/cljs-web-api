  an `event` created using `Document.createEvent()`.

  `event.initEvent(type, bubbles, cancelable);


  type
  Is a `web.dom.DOMString` defining the type of event.
  bubbles
  Is a `js.Boolean` deciding whether the event should bubble up through the event chain or not. Once set, the read-only property `Event.bubbles` will give its value.
