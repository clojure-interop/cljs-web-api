  "Constructor.

  The FetchEvent() constructor creates a new `web.workers.FetchEvent` object.

  type
  The type of the Event.
  init Optional
  An options object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the event object. Options are as follows:

  request: The `web.fetch.Request` object that would have triggered the event handler.
  clientId: The `web.service-workers.Client` that the current service worker is controlling. This property is not yet implemented in Chrome.
  isReload: A `js.Boolean` that signifies whether the page was reloaded or not when the event was dispatched. true if yes, and false if not. Typically, pressing the refresh button in a browser is a reload, while clicking a link and pressing the back button is not. If not present, it defaults to false.
