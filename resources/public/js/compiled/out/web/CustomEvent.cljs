  A `dom.DOMString` representing the name of the event.
  customEventInit Optional
  A CustomEventInit dictionary, having the following fields:

  \\\"detail\\\", optional and defaulting to null, of type any, that is an event-dependent value associated with the event.



  The CustomEventInit dictionary also accepts fields from the `web.EventInit` dictionary.
