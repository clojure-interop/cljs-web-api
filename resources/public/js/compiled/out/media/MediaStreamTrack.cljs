(defn apply-constraints
  "Method.

  The applyConstraints() method of the `media.MediaStreamTrack`
  applies a set of constraints to the track; these constraints
  the Web site or app establish ideal values and acceptable ranges
  values for the constrainable properties of the track, such as
  rate, dimensions, echo cancelation, and so forth.

  site or application has specified are required or acceptable

(defn stop
  "Method.

  In short, the `media.MediaStreamTrack` method stop() method stops
  track.

  `MediaStreamTrack.stop();

  Calling stop() tells the user agent that the track's source—whatever that source may be, including files, network streams, or a local camera or microphone—is no longer needed by the MediaStreamTrack.  Since multiple tracks may use the same source (for example, if two tabs are using the device's microphone), the source itself isn't necessarily immediately stopped. It is instead disassociated from the track and the track object is stopped. Once no media tracks are using the source, the source may actually be completely stopped.

  Immediately after calling stop(), the `web.track` state is set to ended.`
